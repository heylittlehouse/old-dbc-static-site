  <h1>Starting with version control</h1>

      Version control is a method that developers use to give themselves greater flexibility to experiment, control, and document their projects.  Git and Github are two different but compatable resources that allow devs to do version control.  One of the major advantages of version control is Tracking Changes. Perhaps you're familiar with the tracking changes feature on Microsoft Word? The program shows what was changed, what it was changed to, who changed it, and when. Git and Github do the same, so when working in a collaborative project you can see who is responsible for what changes. More, you can document the reasons why you have made those changes and what problems they fix.  The saved changes that you make to the project are called 'commits', and every commit is documented and saved as part of the history of the file and each commit (representing an earlier stage of your work) is accessable to you at any point in the future.  To give you even more fine control over the integrity of your work, in git you can create a new branch (or in GitHub, fork), which is to say an exact copy of your file, so you can experiment with new possibilities in that fresh file while keeping your master file untouched, saved, and still fully functional. When you finally do have working code in your new branch, you can merge it back into the master.  Without this feature, if you wrote buggy code directly in the master file, you would have a lot more of a headache sorting through everything.
    </p>
    <p>
       So as you are branching and making commits and merging those commits back into master files, git keeps track of every thing that's happening--every branch, commit, comment, and merge is recorded. If there's ever any problem git allows you to go back to earlier stages of your project and go from there. You can also read your old commit messages to gain a better understanding of your work.
    </p>
    <p>
       GitHub is a convenient place to host your work because it allows for collaboration on code over the internet. By making your code open source, you invite people from all over the world to collaborate, comment, and improve your code because the master file you work from is hosted on the site. On GitHub you can likewise branch off others' repositories and work on code on your own account and push it back to them.

       I hope this served as a good mini-introduction to version control, git, and GitHub!
