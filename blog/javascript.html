  <h1>Javascript</h1>
  <h2>Constructor Functions vs. Ruby Classes</h2>
  <h4>4 October 2015</h4>

  <section><p>The differences between Javascript constructor functions and Ruby classes are interesting to me because on the outside, they seem to function very similarly, that is, they are the outer shell to a series of interrelated functions/methods/data that are instantiated and are thus able to be called repeatedly with differing data without a problem.  The thing that distinguishes them for me is something less concrete and more philosophical: what kind of position they occupy in the mind of the programmer.</p>
  <p>To me, writing a Ruby class is almost like describing and creating a real world object. A class says, "This is something, it exists, this is what it does (methods)". A constructor function is not so, because in a more basic sense, it is not syntactically different from regular functions, which would be like if Ruby classes were just another kind of method.</p>
