  <h1>Kitchen Vs. Table</h1>

      This video has made me even more excited to be a part of the Dev Bootcamp experience. It's clear from this and other videos we've watched that Dev Bootcamp is all about empowering their students to become masters of their own learning, which will be driven by each person's own curiosity and interest.  I've come to this conclusion about learning in my own life outside of coding and I love the idea that teachers and students really all being co-conspirators of the same transformational experience.

        At the same time, however, as great of an opportunity this is, DBC's unique teaching style is also a challenge to its students. We have this incredible responsibility to overcome the "table" mindset Shereef talks about in the video and have to really dig into ourselves to become creators of our own education and future. This will be a huge challenge as much as it will be exciting and enjoyable.

        But most of all we will have to take this sense with us beyond DBC because DBC can only take us so far in such a short period of time. Programmers are life long learners, sure, but we'll still have a lot to learn in our first jobs and beyond.  It's intimidating to think about, but I'm sure I'll be ready when it comes.
