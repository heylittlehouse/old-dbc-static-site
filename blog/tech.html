  <h1>Computer Memory</h1>
  <h2>What are we talking about again?</h2>
  <h4>13 October 2015</h4>

  <section><p>What *is* computer memory? I decided to research this topic since it fell outside the immediate goal of learning programming languages, and yet is something so essential for understanding computers. I had no idea what it was or how it worked outside that there is memory for hard disks and RAM.</p>
  <p>It turns out, RAM is what is most often called memory, and hard disks are more often referred to as storage, though the two are lumped in conversation to be able to distinguish their purpose.  RAM is a stored information that requires a power connection to maintain its memory. Once power is lost, memory is gone. Hard disks (and other things like CD-RWs, flash drives, etc) on the other hand don't need power to retain the stored data. That's what keeps all your documents in place on a computer when you come back to it after turning it off (you turn off your computer, right??).</p>
  <p>Modern computers of course come with both kinds of memory, with RAM being a favorite because of its great speed and efficiency at accessing data and other forms of storage for its long-term usability. The best way to distinguish is perhaps to think of RAM as the temporary workspace for your project while storage is the carefully filed library. It's easier to grab stuff immediately from your workspace, but if you have too much open it gets cluttered and disfunctional. On the other hand, your library takes a while to comb through and find something, but you keep it there so you can always have it around and in the long run all those files will be helpful, but they're not always in immediate need.</p></section>
