<!--Comments:
1) Wireframing was very simple with my partner. He had a good basic template in mind from which to work and we discussed what other possibile forms the page might take and we had very few problems writing the HTML together.
2) Yes, I think it's good to have a general idea about what kind of layout you want to commit yourself to because then knowing what markup to write becomes very straight forward. It's way better than staring at a blank screen, imagining all the possibilties, writing code, deciding it doesn't work or would work better some other way and the code getting messy.
3) Frankly, we went with the most basic and standard layout. Why deviate from established greatness when we're only padiwan learners?
4) I didn't learn any new semantics on this challenge, I had already had a basic grasp of html before starting the course. -->
