  <h1>About Me:</h1>
  <h4>A Brief History</h4>

  <section><p>Native son of Southern California, Michael is a top-notch web developer ready for hire that has been called "the fastest learner I've ever taught". The greatest asset I bring to the table is a willingness and a facility of learning that you won't find elsewhere.</p>
  <p>After receiving a full tuition academic scholarship, I graduated from Fordham University in New York City with a degree in Philosophy in 2013 and am excited to pursue a career that utilizes every day the logical training I had studying philosophy. My favorite philosopher is Nietzsche, with a special shout out to the little-known Boethius, whose book <em>The Consolation of Philosophy</em> changed my life.</p>

  <p>I speak English, Spanish, and French. I have professional work experience in Spanish, when I interned at the Spanish Consulate in Boston the summer of 2012, and have a published article also written in Spanish.</p>

  <p>I am a guitarist, bassist, fake keyboardist, and songwriter. I have played shows around the greater Los Angeles area. Below is one of my songs. You can listen to more <a href="https://soundcloud.com/apache-wilds">here</a>.</p>

  <p>I'm occasionally a serious runner. In high school I was a scoring member of the varsity cross country team, responsible for our 4th place finish in the California Division II State Championships. After college I started training again and in 2014 set a new personal best for the 5K (16:10) and raced my first 10K (34:52). My personal best in the mile still stands from high school (4:36). I've run more times than I can count a half-marathon distance (or greater) as part of my training for 5Ks, but have never raced one. I have not run a marathon yet either, but will one day soon!</p>

  <p>Other things I enjoy include: juggling, slackling, juggling on a slackline, body surfing, bouldering, craft beer, and dry Italian and Spanish wine.</p>
